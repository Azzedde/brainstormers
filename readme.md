# ðŸ§  Brainstormers

Built with **LangChain** and **Streamlit**, this tool enhances your brainstorming experience by offering curated, optimized chains inspired by real-world effective brainstorming techniques. Rather than using ChatGPT directly, this app allows you to engage with structured brainstorming methods, guiding you to explore ideas comprehensively and maximize the benefits of LLM-driven brainstorming.

This app provides various brainstorming techniques:
- **[Big Mind Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19275)**: Expands ideas across a wide scope, ideal for when you need to gather a maximum number of ideas.
- **[Reverse Brainstorming](https://info.orchidea.dev/innovation-blog/guide-to-ai-powered-brainstorming-sessions)**: Identifies ways to create a problem, revealing potential pitfalls and fostering innovative solutions.
- **[Role Storming](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-digital-self/202403/how-ai-can-transform-brainstorming)**: Encourages adopting different perspectives to gather diverse insights.
- **[SCAMPER](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/learn-how-to-use-the-best-ideation-methods-scamper)**: Applies the SCAMPER technique (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse) to prompt unique ideas.
- **[Six Thinking Hats](https://www.groupmap.com/portfolio/six-thinking-hats)**: Based on Edward de Bonoâ€™s method, examines ideas from six angles: Data, Emotions, Risks, Benefits, Creativity, and Process Management.
- **[Starbursting](https://lucidspark.com/blog/how-to-use-starbursting-for-brainstorming)**: Generates questions using the 5 W's and 1 H (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How), offering in-depth topic exploration.

## Project Pipeline
The appâ€™s pipeline is streamlined: instead of using agents or Langraph, it runs specific chains based on the selected brainstorming method. Each method initiates a structured chain tailored to the userâ€™s choice. The output is organized into a tree of ideas, with an initial layer of ideas followed by deeper expansions as per each method's principles. For example, the Starbursting method generates detailed questions for each initial idea, followed by answers.

Results are presented as a hierarchical tree of ideas:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, idea):
        self.idea = idea
        self.children = []

    def add_child(self, child_node):
        self.children.append(child_node)
```
